## Overview

[Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) is a hosted search platform you can use on your Jekyll site. They offer high performance search which can be customised to your usecase and even provide a [Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-jekyll) to help you index your content. If your site has under 10,000 searches a month you can use Algolia for free.

## Setup

1. [Sign up](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up) for an Algolia account.
2. Work through the introduction tutorial. It'l give you a good understanding of how to tune your search later on.
3. Create a new index for your Jekyll site
4. Go to API Keys and take note of your Application ID and Admin API Key
5. Add algoliasearch-jekyll to the jekyll_plugins group in your Gemfile:
    ~~~ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    gem 'jekyll', '3.3.1'

    group :jekyll_plugins do
      gem 'algoliasearch-jekyll'
    end
    ~~~
6. Run `bundle install`
7. Add your algolia Application ID and index name to `_config.yml`:

   ~~~yaml
   algolia:
     application_id: 'your_application_id'
     index_name: 'your_index_name'
   ~~~
8. Set your write key as an environment variable `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` or in a file called `_algolia_api_key`. If you use the file method make sure it's not checked into a public repository otherwise anyone could add content to your search. For the environment variable you can simply prefix the command with it, for example:

~~~bash
ALGOLIA_API_KEY='YOUR KEY' bundle exec jekyll algolia push
~~~

## Usage

To generate an index and push it to Algolia you can use the `push command`.

~~~bash
bundle exec jekyll algolia push
~~~

*Note: We don't currently have a way of running this command on CloudCannon. You can get around this by setting up [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) as mentioned in their [documentation](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-jekyll).*

Once the data is on Algolia you can use their [JavaScript library](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/javascript/getting-started/) to perform searches.

## Configuration

The plugin allows you to complete configure what pages are index, the content in those pages and index settings. Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-jekyll) for more information.
